# ib-gateway-service
A light-weight node server to programatically control the [IBKR Client Portal Web gateway](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/cpwebapi/).
This service supports automatic authentication, including two factor with with IBKey or SMS.

Under the hood, this does not use any sort of android emulator nor browser, *everything*
 (including two factor) is done via http requests.

# Getting started
#### Fetch the docker image:
 ```
 docker pull mjherrma/ib-gateway-service:3.0.1
```
#### Start the service:
```
docker run -p 5050:5050 -p 5000:5000 mjherrma/ib-gateway-service:3.0.1
```
#### Start Client Portal (CP) gateway:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:5050/api/service
```
#### Authenticate CP gateway (assuming no 2nd factor required):
```
curl -X PUT -d "username=USERNAME&password=PASSWORD" http://localhost:5050/api/service
```
Now the CP gateway is ready to go: `curl -k https://localhost:5000/v1/portal/iserver/auth/status`

#### Stop CP gateway:
```
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5050/api/service
```

# Authentication
This service enables a truly headless login to the IB gateway, even with their two factor
 authentication. However, it requires a SMS number with twilio to be set up. If you don't have a twilio number,
the next best is to use [IBKey](#ibkey-authentication) which will require manual reset every 100 logins.

## Automatic login (requires twilio)
```aiignore
IB_AUTH_USE_IBKEY=false
IB_AUTH_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=XXXXXXXXXXXXX # must be set
IB_AUTH_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXX # must be set
```

IB Gateway Service is setup to use [twilio](https://www.twilio.com) for SMS two factor.
Register your IB account with a twilio phone number and then provide the IB Gateway Service
 with the twilio account SID and auth token via environment variables.
 
I recommend [adding another user](https://www.ibkrguides.com/orgportal/uar/addingauser.htm) to your IBKR account, which you will use for API login.
When creating this user, you have options to limit permissions (likely you'll want to share market data and trading permissions) and set the phone number.
Be sure you use your twilio phone number hereâ€”this way you can receive the two factor SMS programmatically.

Note that IB does not allow you to change your second factor phone number after creating an
account. If you already have a personal phone number connected, a way around this is to use an SMS
forwarding app on your phone to automatically forward the IB SMS messages to the twilio phone number.

## Semi-Automatic login
```aiignore
IB_AUTH_USE_IBKEY=true
IB_GATEWAY_DATA_STORE_PATH=/auth/data/path # will be used
```
If you can't use twilio (or don't want to pay for it), you can use the IBKey authentication
 method. This will require you to set up IBKey on your computer and then provide the secret
 to the service via the environment variable `IB_AUTH_OCRA_SECRET`.

You will have to repeat this process at least every 100 logins (`IB_AUTH_MAX_COUNTER`), but between those logins, the service
will automatically be able to login with two factor.

In order to set up IBKey, you need to run the IBKey setup script:
```
docker run -it mjherrma/ib-gateway-service:3.0.1 bash -c 'npm run setup-ibkey'
```
If successful, the script will output the IBKey auth data. This must be saved as a json file
named `data.json` and placed in `IB_GATEWAY_DATA_STORE_PATH` 
  
**Important:** the path to `IB_GATEWAY_DATA_STORE_PATH` must persist as long as you want to keep
 using IBKey login without setting it up again. Each login attempt increments a counter, which is
  stored at that data path.

## Using both methods
```aiignore
IB_AUTH_USE_IBKEY=true
IB_AUTH_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=XXXXXXXXXXXXX # must be set
IB_AUTH_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXX # must be set
IB_GATEWAY_DATA_STORE_PATH=/auth/data/path # will be used
```
You can use both methods at the same time. The only real advantage to this is to reduce the number of
twilio SMS messages (by up to 100x). Since IBKey will only need to reset once per 100 logins using
SMS authentication. (So some small cost savings with twilio, but you need to be using it a lot for it to be significant).

## One last note - Max attempts
In order to prevent accidentally locking the IB account, this service will stop attempting to
 login after `IB_AUTH_MAX_ATTEMPTS` consecutive failed attempts. If this happens, it requires
  manual reset by updating the attempts value in `${IB_GATEWAY_DATA_STORE_PATH}/data.json` to `0`.
